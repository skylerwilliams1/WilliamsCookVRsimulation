VRSimulation.R and VRSimulation_post_processing.R include the simulation and post processing code used to produce the simulation study described in the manuscript, "Analysis of Analytical Treatment Interruption Trials with Misclassified Interval-Censored Data: A Systematic Review and Simulation Study." The authors of this project are Skyler Williams (Smith College, Massachusetts General Hospital) and Kaitlyn Cook (Smith College). Find the full description and explanation of our simulation study in the publication. Below, we briefly describe how to run the simulation and post processing, although both scripts are commented with further detail and explanation.  We also offer a description for each variable in the final dataset that the simulation and post-processing returns. Notably, our code to calculate the RMST and execute the test of the difference in RMST with interval-censored data is included in VRSimulation.R. 

## VRSimulation.R

### Required arguments:

- tau: the restriction time (in weeks) for the RMST. We used tau = 8.
- n_participants: the one-arm sample size. We used 100 and 25.
- beta2a: the delay in viral rebound parameter for trial arm one. We used 6.94.
- beta2b: the delay in viral rebound parameter for trial arm two. We used 6.94, 9.14, and 11.34.
- alpha: the desired significance level for hypothesis tests. We used 0.05.
- delta: one half of the clinical visit window for viral load monitoring (in weeks). We used 0.5.
- n_visits: the number of viral load monitoring visits at regular intervals over 48 weeks. Our function only takes 48, 24, and 12, but can be easily altered to take other values.

### Instructions:

- To run one simulation setting with 1000 runs, simply load all functions in order and run the while loop at the bottom. Specify the arguments as you wish.
- The code will return a list with 1000 items, where each item contains the result of 1 run (1 dataset generated and analyzed). Save this list and proceed to post-processing.

## VRSimulation_post_processing.R

### Required arguments:

The same as VRSimulation.R, in addition to:

- v: the list returned by VRSimulation.R
- runs: the number of runs used in VRSimulation.R. We used 1000.

### Instructions:

- Simply load and run the post_processing function with the arguments specified as appropriate.
- A data frame will be returned with the full results.
